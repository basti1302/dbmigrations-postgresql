Name:                dbmigrations-postgresql
Version:             2.0.0
Synopsis:            The moo executable for PostgreSQL to work with dbmigrations
Description:         This package contains the executable to work with
                     the dbmigrations package when the database backend
                     is PostgreSQL. See the package dbmigrations for details
                     about the dbmigrations project in general.

                     This particular package only supports PostgreSQL.
                     There are other similar packages for other
                     databases, for example for MySQL and SQLite.

                     To get started, see the 'README.md'
                     (https://github.com/jtdaugherty/dbmigrations/blob/master/README.md)
                     and 'MOO.TXT'
                     (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jtdaugherty/dbmigrations/master/MOO.TXT)
                     files included in the dbmigrations package and to
                     the usage output for the 'moo-postgresql' command.

                     The executable in this package works exactly the
                     same (as described in the dbmigrations package),
                     with only two differences:
                     * The executable this package provides is called
                       'moo-postgresql' instead of 'moo'.
                     * The executable in this package only supports PostgreSQL.
                       Consequently, you do not need to specify the
                       database type via DBM_DATABASE_TYPE.
